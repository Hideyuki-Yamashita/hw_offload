Log directory for SPP processes.

The name of log file of secondary process is decided with a combination
of process name and secondary ID. For example, name of log of `nfv:1` is
`spp_nfv-1.log`, or `vf:2` is `spp_vf-2.log`.

The name of log of primary process is simply `spp_primary.log` because
it has no process ID.
